I am a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.ucsd.edu) at the [University of California, San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Rose Yu](https://roseyu.com). I received my Master's degree in computer science from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu), and Bachelor degrees in computer science and physics from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu). 

I am broadly interested in deep learning theory and optimization. Currently, I am studying symmetries in the parameter space and dynamics of learning.
