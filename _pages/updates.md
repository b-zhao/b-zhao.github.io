2025-06 New survey paper: [Symmetry in Neural Network Parameter Spaces](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2506.13018)


2025-06 Interning this summer at Capital One in New York, NY.

2025-05 Our paper [Understanding Mode Connectivity via Parameter Space Symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23681) was accepted at ICML 2025.

2025-03 New workshop paper [Improving Learning to Optimize Using Parameter Symmetries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15399) to appear at the [Workshop on Neural Network Weights as a New Data Modality](https://weight-space-learning.github.io/) at ICLR 2025.

2024-12 We are organizing a workshop on weight space learning at ICLR 2025! Details on [weight-space-learning.github.io](https://weight-space-learning.github.io/)

2024-12 I will be attending NeurIPS in person this year! Happy to learn about symmetry, LLMs, and everything.
We will present two extended abstracts at the workshops: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • 
[Symmetry Discovery in Neural Network Parameter Spaces
](https://openreview.net/forum?id=qPR9a9IotY) at [UniReps](https://unireps.org/2024/) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • 
[Emergence of Hierarchical Emotion Representations in Large Language Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vgXUoCrHmp) at [SciForDL](https://scienceofdlworkshop.github.io).

2024-12 Honored to be selected as an NVIDIA Graduate Fellowship Finalist.
